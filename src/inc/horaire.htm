<ul>
  <li>The <b>Sector</b>(Sh), either <i>Audio</i>, <i>Visual</i>, or <i>Research</i>, is the general sector of the task.</li>
  <li>The <b>Concrete Hour</b>(Ch) represents a value of concrete output, or index of progress toward the release of a project — where 1 indicates an introverted task like documentation, or planning, and 9 indicates an extroverted task like giving a talk, or releasing a project.</li>
  <li>The <b>Focus Hour</b>(Fh) is an index of attention for the day's task — where 1 indicates that almost no time was invested in the task, and 9 indicates that most of the available time was invested in the task.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>General Productivity</b>(Ph) is not seen an a net positive, but as a value that speaks of how reflective a project is, or a value that indicates how much time was spent on planning, against time spent on user-facing assets. Certain types of project will naturally have a high index of productivity, while others will not. Productivity might also shift during a project's lifetime as it goes from a prototype(low concrete output), to a full release with its media assets(high concrete output) and through the periods of maintenance(back to low concrete output) that follows.</p>

<p>A <b>task name</b> can be generated from the intersection of <code>Ch</code> and <code>Fh</code>. For example, the code <code>238</code>, can be converted into <b>8fh</b>, for the <i>storyboard</i> task.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>As explained above, a <b>fh is not equal to an hour</b>, a fh is ratio of invested time over total available time. For example, a good day might look like: 3 pomodoros(~90min) over 3 hours(~180min) equivalent to 50% of available time, or 6fh. And a day of lesser focus might look like: 2 pomodoros(~60min), over 6 hours(~360min) equivalent to 15% of available time, or 2fh. Furthermore, a harder task would be more fh(time spent), over less ch(concrete output), meaning that a high fh does not necessarily correlate with productivity. </p>
